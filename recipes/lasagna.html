    <h3>Freshly baked lasagna</h3>
        <p>This is one of my all time favourite meals and is ideal for serving guests at social events or when meeting with the family. This dish can appear to be a little difficult to make so I have created this super simple recipe that can be followed to make this tatsy dish.</p>
        <p>The ingridents and steps needed to make the super simple lasagna are listed below:</p>
    <h4>ingredients</h4>
        <li>400g minced beef</li>
        <li>9 lasagna pasta sheets</li>
        <li>1 jar of spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>900g of cottage cheese</li>
        <li>3 cups of grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of dried parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pan over medium heat brown the ground beef. Drain the grease. Add spaghetti sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the cottage cheese, 2 cups of the mozzarella cheese, eggs, half of the grated Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt and ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>To assemble, in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish evenly spread 3/4 cup of the sauce mixture. Cover with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles, 1 3/4 cup of the cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup sauce. Repeat layers once more: top with 3 noodles, remaining sauce, remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Add 1/2 cup water to the edges of the pan. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated 175 degrees C (350 degree F) oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Let it stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
